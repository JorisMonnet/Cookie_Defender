For thousands of centuries, in the small funny village of Sevenans,
the Cook's family hide and protect the sacred cookie's recipe of aunty Georgia.
This cookie is full of flavor and crispy but also with a bit of hony....
Hum this cookie is damn perfect !
By the past and currently the Cookie's War shred all the Sevenans's scholar on break time.
The war never stops ! 
Go on soldier !
